# Secret Code Language Translator 🕵️‍♂️🔐

A simple Python-based message encoder and decoder that scrambles text into a secret code by adding random characters and shifting letters. Easily encode messages and decode them back using the same logic.

**🚀 Features**

✅ Encode & Decode messages with a simple shift-based technique.

✅ Randomized Characters make messages look unreadable without decoding.

✅ Error Handling for invalid inputs.

✅ Interactive UI for multiple encodings & decodings in one session.

✅ Reversible Logic – Encode a message and decode it back perfectly!

**🔧 How It Works**

**🔹 Encoding:**

--The user enters a message.

--Random characters are added to the beginning and end of words.

--The first letter of each word is moved to the end.

--Short words (less than 3 letters) are simply reversed.

**🔹 Decoding:**

**--** The user inputs the encoded message.

--Extra characters are removed.

--The last letter is shifted back to the start.

--Short words are reversed back to normal.
